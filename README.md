welcome to my github! 

i'm a teen who likes to make silly little videogames and sometimes even boring tools ! i mostly use rust, its a really fun language!

#

my favorite projects are probably:

#

i really [hackclub](https://hackclub.com/), its a really cool place with an awesome community! 

ive so far partaken in two of their major events, summer of making, and siege. and for prizes, ive won a steamdeck, 3d printer, and a framework 13 laptop!

#

anyways, hope you enjoy your stay here !
